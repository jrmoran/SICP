# SICP

These are my solutions to the exercises in the SICP.


## Tools
I'm using **gambit-scheme**

    brew install gambit-scheme

The REPL is lauched with `scheme-r5rs`.

My text editor is Vim which I use with vim-slime along GNU screen.

## Other Tools

Many people recommend installing [Racket 5.2.1](http://racket-lang.org) and
use the standard dialect of [Scheme R5RS](http://docs.racket-lang.org/r5rs/plt-r5rs.html)

Racket comes with its own text editor, but you can start the Scheme REPL from 
the command line by running

    /<racket root dir>/bin/plt-r5rs
